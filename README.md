# Hangman (Terminal)

## About the Project
This is a **terminal-based Hangman game** built in Python as part of a course assignment on Codecademy. The goal of the assignment was to create a small interactive program that runs entirely in the command line.

I chose Hangman even though it wasn’t included in the suggested project ideas, because it felt achievable within a short timeframe while still allowing room to practice clean structure and user interaction.

## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to practice **fundamental Python concepts** in a constrained environment. By working in the terminal, the focus stays on logic, flow, and interaction rather than UI or external libraries.

It also served as a quick, self-contained exercise to:
- Build something from scratch  
- Apply course concepts independently  
- Practice writing and structuring a complete, runnable program  

## Tech Stack
- **Python** – core game logic  
- **Command-line interface** – terminal-based user interaction  
- **Standard input/output** – player interaction via `input()` and printed feedback  
- **Built-in data structures** – dictionary-based word storage per difficulty level  
- **Git** – version control during development  

## Features
- Classic **Hangman** gameplay in the terminal  
- Multiple **difficulty levels**, each with its own word list  
- Word selection based on chosen difficulty  
- Interactive user input for guessing letters  
- Clear game loop with win/lose conditions  
- Object-oriented structure using a **Game class**  
- Runs entirely in the command line with no external dependencies  

## Time Spent
The total development time was roughly **2 hours**, spread over **2 days**. While there are areas that could be improved or expanded, the focus of this project was on **progress and completion** rather than perfection.

## Assignment Objectives
The objectives of the original assignment were:
- Build a terminal program using Python  
- Add at least one interactive feature using `input()`  
- Use Git for version control  
- Use the command line and file navigation  
- Write a technical blog post about the project  

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository  
2. Navigate to the project directory  
3. Run the game with:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
