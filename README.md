# Hangman in the terminal

## How to play
Clone the repo and type python3 main.py!

## Why this project
For a course I am following on Codecademy I had to create a terminal game. I decided on hangman since it wasn't in the suggestion list and seemed doable in a short timespan.

### Time
The total time for this is roughly 2 hours, spread out over 2 days. There are some improvements I could make but for the sake of progress this will do for now.

### Objectives
The objectives of the assignment were:
* Build a terminal program using Python
* Add at least one interactive feature using input()
* Use Git version control
* Use the command line and file navigation
* Write a technical blog post on the project

I decided to use a class for running the game as well. It seemed easier and logical.
